# Explore EMNIST Letter Dataset with Prediction 

Explore the EMNIST letter dataset with various dimensionality reduction techniques and visualizations, and then create an ML model to predict handwritten letters.

# Project Overview
1. Load and select subset of EMNIST Letter dataset
1. Apply various dimensionality reduction techniques with visualizations
1. Create an ML model for prediction
1. Take hand drawn user inputs to create live predictions
1. Visualize prediction bar charts
1. Create interactive web app deployment

# Loading EMNIST Dataset
When exploring various was to import the EMNIST dataset we came across a pre-made Python library called [emnist](https://pypi.org/project/emnist/) which made loading the various sets of data into our project straight forward and simple. After a few custom functions we were able to generate quick visualizations of the letters along with their labels.

# Dimensionality Reduction Techniques
During the data exploration stage we applied several dimensionality reduction techniques to better visualize how the letter images could be clustered together. The highlights are PCA (Principal Component Analysis) which is a good baseline technique and UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) which provide clearer clusters and better separation. Images shown below and full code can be found in the [dev_notebooks folder](https://github.com/coryroyce/emnist_letter_exploration_and_prediction/blob/main/dev_notebooks/Letter_Exploration_and_Classification_V04.ipynb).
